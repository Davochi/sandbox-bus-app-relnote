# Accessible apps out of the box

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


Model-driven apps are metadata-driven. Core components of the user
experience, such as dashboards, lists, navigation, forms, and commands,
are generated upon creation of the entity. Standard components, such as
charts, lists, and controls, are built to Microsoft accessibility
standards (go to the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/accessibility) to learn about our industryâ€‘leading
accessibility
standards).

By default, any app built using these components is also accessible. The
custom control framework that controls are built on also provides
accessibility hooks, so that any new controls that are created can
easily be made accessible.
