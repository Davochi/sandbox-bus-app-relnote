# Model-driven apps

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

In addition to the canvas app development that PowerApps has been known
for, which provides full visual control over the user experience of an
app, PowerApps now offers another choice for high-productivity app
development. With model‑driven applications, app developers can start
building an app with their data model instead. They can model entities
and their associated business rules, processes, forms, views, and
dashboards. From this model, they can easily generate immersive user
experiences by using the app designer.

To get started with model‑driven apps, use designers to:

-   **Define your site map.** Model your app's navigation, pulling in
    only the subset of information your users need. Take advantage of
    multiple levels of hierarchy and the ability to reference external
    resources.

-   **Add dashboards.** Include model‑driven dashboards or embedded
    Power BI content within your app.

-   **Include entities and components.** Add specific forms, views,
    dashboards, and charts for targeted entities to craft your user
    experience.
