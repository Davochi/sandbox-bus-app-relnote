# Metadata-driven responsive user experiences

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Model-driven apps are responsive across different form factors and
devices, allowing users to quickly continue their work while on the go.Â 

Responsive user experiences allow for:

-   A single layout for forms, dashboards, and lists that automatically
    reflows.

-   Navigation and grids that adapt to mobile devices to enable
    efficient touch interactions.

-   Visual controls that are optimized for touch and provide engaging
    user experiences. Examples include Slider, Arc, and Calendar
    controls.
