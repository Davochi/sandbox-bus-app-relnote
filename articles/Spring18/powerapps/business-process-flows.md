# Business process flows

[!INCLUDE [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Use a business process flow to define a set of steps for people to
follow to take them to a desired outcome. These steps provide a visual
indicator that tells people where they are in the business process.
Business process flows reduce the need for training, because new users
donâ€™t have to focus on which entity they should be using. They can let
the process guide them.

For example, you can configure business process flows to support common
sales methodologies that can help your sales groups achieve better
results. Or, for service groups, business process flows can help new
staff get up to speed more quickly and avoid mistakes that could result
in unsatisfied customers. The user experience can be tailored so that
people with different security roles can have an experience that best
fits the work they do in PowerApps.

business process flow to standardize
processes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/create-business-process-flow).
